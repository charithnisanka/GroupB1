			<h3>Cadastral surveying</h3>
				<p>Cadastral surveying is the discipline of land surveying that relates to the laws of 
				land ownership and the definition of property boundaries.  It involves interpreting and 
				advising on boundary locations, on the status of land ownership and on the rights, 
				restrictions and interests in property, as well as the recording of such information 
				for use on plans, maps, etc.  It also involves the physical delineation of property 
				boundaries and determination of dimensions, areas and certain rights associated with 
				properties, whether they are on land, water or defined by natural or artificial features.</p>
				
				<p>GeoTech Topographic staff is a well-organized and a prooven organization over the
				past couple of decades for cadastral surveying. Our dedicated staff include many Licensed
				surveyors who has decades of experience in cadastral surveying.</p>
