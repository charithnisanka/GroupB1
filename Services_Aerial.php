 <h2 style=text-align:center;> Aerial Surveying Division of GeoTech</h2>
 <div class="container"><p style=text-align:center;><b>GeoTech features the next generation of geospatial 
 solutions that encompass aerial photography (using the UltraCam Falcon prime digital 
 aerial mapping camera), photogrammetry, remote sensing and geographic information systems.
 Our leadership team has a 10-year legacy of success in meeting and exceeding our clients' 
 mission-critical needs  that have rigorous mapping, CADD, GIS and orthophoto standards 
 and specifications. And this is reflected in our high client retention rate along with a legion of 
 satisfied customers. </p></b></div>

			<h3>Aerial Imagery</h3>
			

				<p>GeoTech provides precision flight mission planning, 
					flying and acquisition of aerial imagery to engineering firms, 
					municipalities, government agencies, architects, surveyors and 
					planners for both government and private sectors.</p>
				 
				<p>Our aerial photography is acquired primarily using precision 
				Digital Aerial Mapping Cameras or the traditional film-based 
				aerial mapping cameras (such as the Leica Geosystems RC-30 or 
				Zeiss RMK Top 15) which are equipped with forward image-motion 
				compensation (FMC), GPS triggering and control capability, 
				and distortion-free lens systems. We offer a full digital workflow option, 
				from 3D flight planning all the way through to final delivery, 
				eliminating film processing and scanning completely; in fact, 
				this allows us to start working with aerial imagery that's hot off the runway.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<h3>Photogrammetric Scanning and printing</h3>
				<p>This encompasses scanning of aerial film; digital image compression services;
				and production of a wide variety of aerial image products such as photo mosaics, 
				photo index layouts, and contact prints that are reproduced on photo paper. Archive 
				quality, mylar, mounting and lamination options are also available.</p>
 
				<p>Our digital files are delivered either on CD/DVD/portable hard drives or via 
				online FTP transfer.</p>
	
				<p>For conventional film based projects, GeoTech performs direct scanning of the aerial
				negatives in preparation for digital aerotriangulation, map compilation, and image
				rectification. We use the most sophisticated precision photogrammetric roll fed 
				scanner (DSW-700) capable of resolutions of 12microns (2117 dpi) with 0.5micron accuracy.
				Our high quality digital imagery is stored in a secure environment on a 30-terrabyte
				RAID Level 5 data storage system.</p>

			<h3>Airborne Global Positioning System(AGPS)</h3>
					<p>GeoTech offers airborne GPS services that allow us to establish 
					photogrammetric control from the air as mapping photography is acquired. 
					We do this by recording a GPS coordinate for the precise geometric 
					center of the aerial photograph at the instant the camera shutter is 
					triggered. AGPS is appropriate for large mapping projects having 
					positional accuracy requirements for 2', 4' or 5' contours, and can 
					offer significant cost savings due to decreased field survey ground control.</p>
			
 
		</div> 
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<h3>Digital Aerial Triangulation</h3>
				<p>DAAT is a photogrammetric process to densify a framework of field-established ground 
				control to enable mapping over an entire project. It dramatically reduces the need for 
				survey time by eliminating the need to fully control all stereo models in the field. 
				This tried and tested technology is especially beneficial in large projects, and where 
				terrain or manmade features make access to and travel around a project site very 
				difficult. Analytical aerotriangulation also provides an intermediate quality control 
				check on all ground control, enabling any errors to be caught and corrected prior to 
				the mapping phase of the project. Our state-of-the-art facility provides all the 
				necessary equipment and personnel to perform analytical aerotriangulation through 
				conventional means, as well as through the latest softcopy automated techniques. </p>

			<h3>Light Detection and Ranging (LiDar)</h3>
				<p>With the exciting purchase of RIEGL's LMS-Q780 full waveform airborne laser scanner, 
				GeoTech now offers full LiDAR services including data aquisition, post-processing, 
				filtering, and classification.</p>
 
				<p>Light Detection and Ranging is an airborne-based sensing technology that provides 
				geo-referenced, three dimensional point data of the earth's surface. LIDAR integrates 
				three technological components: LASER ( Light Amplification by Simulated Emission of 
				Radiation) , GPS (Global Positioning System) and IMU (Inertial Management Unit) into a 
				single system.</p>
 
				<p>LiDAR offers the benefits of collecting vast amounts of elevation data within a short
				period of time, day or night and regardless of the sun's angle. It is complementary to
				(but not a replacement for) the traditional aerial mapping (photogrammetry) methodology.</p>

		<div class="col-md-6">
			<h3>Photogrammetric mapping</h3>
			<p>GeoTech utilizes next generation digital softcopy workstations, linked to high-speed stereo 
			graphics, enabling us to take advantage of high resolution 3-D digital sensor imagery to 
			perform precise measurements and data collection. These photogrammetric techniques enable us
			to capture planimetric features, topographic data, digital terrain models and contours that 
			are customized to our clients' requirements.</p>
	
			<p>Our sophisticated mapping software provides an unprecedented degree of control over the
			cartographic data that we can offer our clients. It also allows us to manipulate large
			quantities of information efficiently, formatting it precisely to client specifications,
			while running continual data integrity checks to ensure product quality.</p>
