To meet the demands of our ever-changing and increasingly-quicker world, we developed the world’s first MultiStation, combining all available measurement technologies in one superior instrument. Now, we’ve made that instrument even smarter. The Leica Nova MS60 MultiStation is the world’s first self-learning MultiStation, automatically and continuously adapting to any environment, despite any challenges.

Scanning with the Leica Nova MS60 has been made simpler through the instant creation of point clouds with overlaid measured points and 3D models in one view. Visualisations are clearer and easier to see on an all-new 5” screen.

The unique capabilities of the Leica Nova MultiStation truly deliver the new experience in measuring technology.
