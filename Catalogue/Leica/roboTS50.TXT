Engineering companies and contractors face increased challenges monitoring this change. They are being charged with – and being held liable for – the condition of the structures they create and maintain. In order to surmount these challenges, engineers need to be able to measure structural movements to millimetre-level accuracy. For equipment to manage and monitor these structures, engineers rely on Leica Geosystems and the Leica Nova TM50 Monitoring Station: because every half second counts.
