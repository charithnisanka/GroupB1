 <h2 style=text-align:center;> Construction Division of GeoTech</h2>
 <div class="container"><p style=text-align:center;><b>Construction is one of the largest industries in the 
 world and Surveying has always played an important role in any construction project. GeoTech delivers key 
 functions to the build process and supports engineering projects from the initial earth works to final 
 completion. The key functions for our construction surveyors is the establishment of accurate Primary 
 Survey Control, reliable Setting Out, factual As-Built information and producing clear legible AutoCAD 
 drawings.</b></p>

			<h3>STRUCTURAL MONITORING</h3>

				<p>GeoTech is one of the leaders when it comes to Geotechnical, Structural, Sound and 
				Vibration Monitoring and the proof is in our track record. GeoTech is able to provide 
				a wide range of survey monitoring services through the utilisation of survey techniques 
				adapted for monitoring as well as using technologically advanced methods specifically 
				designed for the monitoring environment. Over the past 20 years we have built committed
				relationships with our instrumentation suppliers, these partnerships have proved 
				essential in our development as market leaders.</p>

				<p>Monitoring is carried out when buildings are demolished, assesing movement of adjacent
				structures or retained facades; for deep basement excavations, checking for movement of 
				retaining walls and surrounding buildings or during the construction of tunnels, 
				measuring possible movements within the tunnel and the above surface features.</p>

			<h3>SITE CONTROL & SETTING OUT</h3>
					<p>At GeoTech we believe the establishment and maintenance of an accurate Primary Control
					Network is vital to ensure successful dimensional control over a project. GeoTech prides
					itself on the quality of our work when it comes to Primary Survey Control. Whether 
					it's for a large scale development or a small housing project, GeoTech has been 
					responsible for establishing and maintaining precise survey control for many years 
					involving projects such as shopping centres, large office developments, airports, 
					power stations and many other commercial schemes. Typically, we can provide survey 
					control at all stages of a project, from the initial traverse, establishing the 
					building grid, through to providing gridlines and datum's to all levels of 
					construction. We are able to establish survey control networks to either the Ordnance 
					Survey national grid, related to the architects setting out criteria or develop a best
					fit grid reference to site conditions. With access to Ordnance Survey GeoTech can transfer
					datum's from referenced OS benchmarks or set-up a local level datum.</P>

			<h3>AS-BUILT SURVEYS</h3>
				<p>With there being so many specialist trades on site it's important for the Principal 
				Contractor to carry out dimensional checks. GeoTech offers a non bias approach to reporting
				the facts. Results are compared to the design information and reported clearly as AutoCAD
				drawings. More often than not, deviations from design creeps in as a project races to PC,
				these costly errors never contribute positively to a successful project. Our team at GeoTech 
				believes our as-built surveys are an insurance policy the construction manager cannot do 
				without.</p>

		<div class="col-md-6">
			<h3>ROAD AND HIGHWAY ENGINEERING</h3>
				<p>At GeoTech we have over 20 years experience working in what is perhaps the most 
				challenging environment for our surveyors, who are both experienced and trained 
				to deal with the danger and noise levels associated with a live highway environment.

				All sites are visited prior to work being undertaken and before surveyors start work
				they are briefed fully on the task.

				Once the work has started, surveys are carried out using non-contact methods wherever
				possible, in order to minimize disruption to traffic and to ensure the safety of the 
				survey team.</p>
